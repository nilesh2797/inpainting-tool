# inpainting-tool
This is a implementation of an image inpainting algorithm which uses an isophote driven sampling process and exemplar based texture synthesis method to propogate structures present in the image

Pre-requisites - Linux environment, OpenCV 2.4.x or higher

Instructions to run the code - In the inpainting tool folder just compile inpainter.cpp by compile.sh giving inpainter.cpp as argument e.g. ./compile.sh inpainter.cpp
Which will create an executable named inpainter and run the inpainter executable
